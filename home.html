                <p>Hey! Welcome to Case Study website. This website is designed for a company that deals with building robots and machines, Robotics Private Limited.
                They are working on a huge project which will be used for identifying objects. So, they needed a website to find out which classification model is
                more effective. This is where our website plays a major role.</p>
                <p>Basically, we do case study of the two most used classification model, MS Azure & MobileNet, to find the most effective model. Case Study is a process
                of doing research into the development of a particular person, group, or situation over a period of time.</p>

                <h2>How It Works?</h2>
                <p>This website is free to use as well as user-friendly. You don't even need to make an account use this website. You can simply click on the navigation bar
                    on the top-left corner of the screen and click on "Testing Screen". It will navigate you to the testing screen, there you'll find the images of five objects.
                    Below the images, there you'll find some text written there which is nothing but the results by MS Azure & MobileNet. Based on how many objects did the model
                    found correct, the conclusion will be written at the bottom of the screen.</p>
